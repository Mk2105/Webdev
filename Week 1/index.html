              <h3>Introduction to Table tennis</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content"><p>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
    Table tennis, often referred to as ping pong, is a fast-paced sport that has captivated players and 
    audiences around the world since its inception in the late 19th century. Table tennis 
    is a racket sport derived from tennis but distinguished by its playing surface being atop a stationary table, rather 
    than the court on which players stand. Owed to its small minimum playing area, its ability to be played indoors in all climates,
     and relative accessibility of equipment, table tennis is enjoyed worldwide not just as a competitive sport,
     but as a common recreational pastime among players of all levels and ages.
    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>Originating in England as a
        parlor game among the upper class, table tennis quickly evolved into a competitive sport. By 1926, 
        the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) was established, and the first World Championships
        were held in London.Known for its quick reflexes, strategic gameplay, and
        dynamic rallies, table tennis has grown into a
         globally recognized sport, featuring prominently in the Olympic Games since 1988.</p> 
    <h4>Gameplay Mechanics</h4>
    <p> The game is played on a rectangular table divided by a net, with players using 
        small paddles to hit a lightweight ball back and forth. A standard match consists 
        of either the best of five or seven games, with each game played to 11 points. 
        Players must serve the ball diagonally across the table, and the ball must bounce 
        once on each side before being returned. The objective is to score points by making shots 
        that the opponent cannot return within the rules.</p> </p>
